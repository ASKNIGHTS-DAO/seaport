## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn
- Base or Avalanche network wallet
- Privy credentials

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/seaport-dapp.git
   cd seaport-dapp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Then edit `.env.local` with your actual values.

4. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## üîí Security

### Environment Variables
Never commit sensitive information to the repository. Use `.env.local` for local development and set up environment variables in your deployment platform.

Required environment variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID`: Your Privy application ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_CLIENT_ID`: Your Privy client ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: Your NFT contract address
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_ID`: Your NFT ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AVALANCHE_RPC_URL`: Avalanche RPC URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_RPC_URL`: Base RPC URL

### Security Features
The repository includes several security features to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data:

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**
   - Automatically checks for sensitive data patterns before each commit
   - Prevents commits containing API keys, private keys, or other sensitive information
   - Creates automatic backups before each commit

2. **Git Secrets**
   - Installed and configured to detect sensitive data patterns
   - Checks for common patterns like API keys, private keys, and credentials
   - Includes blockchain-specific patterns for private keys and mnemonics

3. **Automatic Backups**
   - Creates timestamped backups before each commit
   - Stores backups in a dedicated branch
   - Helps prevent work loss in case of crashes or errors

To set up these security features:

```bash
# Install git-secrets
./scripts/setup-git-secrets.sh

# The pre-commit hook is automatically installed
# You can test it by trying to commit a file with sensitive data
```

### Security Best Practices
1. Never commit API keys or private keys
2. Use environment variables for sensitive data
3. Keep dependencies updated
4. Follow the principle of least privilege
5. Implement proper error handling
6. Use secure communication channels
7. Regular security audits
